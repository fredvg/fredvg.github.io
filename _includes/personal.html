<p>When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my amazing wife <a href="http://lauramacchia.com">Laura</a>, and our almost-four year old son Felix. We enjoy all kinds of outdoor activities here in Vermont. I'm originally from Belgium, so mountains and seasons are still somewhat new to me. Before you ask, yes, the chocolate and beer cliches&nbsp;apply.</p>
