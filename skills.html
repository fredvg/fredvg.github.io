                                  <p>In my current position, I've introduced the practice of organising Research Workshops. During these workshops we invite the client over to learn about common web design concepts, strategies and best practices.</p>
                                  <p>Usually, we discuss things like Personas, Style Tiles and Style Guides, Use Cases, Task Analysis, User Stories, etc. We then work with the client to further develop these elements and write up a comprehensive project or product proposal.</p>                                </div>

                                  <p>Before starting any wireframes, and often even before finalizing the application architecture, I like to draw up the Application Flow. Broken down by tasks and inspired by the use cases and other results from the discovery phase. I draw the flow and annotate it with directions and questions for the developers.</p>

                                  <p>Despite this being 2016, and the proliferation of platforms and devices, wireframing is still a crucial step in the design of most web applications. The tools I use vary, sometimes I stick to pen and paper, other times I use Sketch and on occasion I'll go all out and design interactive wireframes using a combination of tools (Sketch, Balsamiq, Marvel, ...). Regardless of the tool I use, I always make sure to annotate well and to sollicit feedback from the developer.</p>

                                  <p>Instead of pixel perfect mockups, I often prefer to build a quick prototype. By leveraging frameworks, libraries, and templates, I find that this is often faster and easier for the client to comprehend.</p>
                                  <p>Some of the tools I use for this are: handcrafted html and css, Jekyll, Drupal or WordPress, and libraries or frameworks such as Bourbon, Neat, Twig, Compass, etc.</p>
                                  <p>Of course some projects still benefit from classic mockups drawn to perfection in Sketch, Photoshop or Illustrator.</p>

Most common application elements and some complete tasks are available as html/css/js snippets. This not only increases efficiencies, it also ensures more consistent front-end code.</p>
