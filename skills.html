				<h3>Research Workshops</h3>
        <img alt="Image1 Illustrating Design Workshops" src="" class="image-1"/>
				<p class="description">In my current position, I've introduced the practice of organising Research Workshops. During these workshops we invite the client over to learn about common web design concepts, strategies and best practices.</p>
        <p>Usually, we discuss things like Personas, Style Tiles and Style Guides, Use Cases, Task Analysis, User Stories, etc. We then work with the client to further develop these elements and write up a comprehensive project or product proposal.</p>

        <h3>Application Flow</h3>
        <img alt="Image1 Illustrating Application Flow" src="" class="image-1"/>
        <p class="description">Before starting any wireframes, and often even before finalizing the application architecture, I like to draw up the Application Flow. Broken down by tasks and inspired by the use cases and other results from the discovery phase. I draw the flow and annotate it with directions and questions for the developers.</p>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <img alt="Image1 Illustrating Wireframes" src="" class="image-1"/>
        <p class="description">Despite this being 2016, and the proliferation of platforms and devices, wireframing is still a crucial step in the design of most web applications. The tools I use vary, sometimes I stick to pen and paper, other times I use Sketch and on occasion I'll go all out and design interactive wireframes using a combination of tools (Sketch, Balsamiq, Marvel, ...). Regardless of the tool I use, I always make sure to annotate well and to sollicit feedback from the developer.</p>

        <h3>Mockups</h3>
        <img alt="Image1 Illustrating Mockups" src="" class="image-1"/>
        <p class="description">Instead of pixel perfect mockups, I often prefer to build a quick prototype. By leveraging frameworks, libraries, and templates, I find that this is often faster and easier for the client to comprehend.</p>
        <p>Some of the tools I use for this are: handcrafted html and css, Jekyll, Drupal or WordPress, and libraries or frameworks such as Bourbon, Neat, Twig, Compass, etc.</p>
        <p>Of course some projects still benefit from classic mockups drawn to perfection in Sketch, Photoshop or Illustrator.</p>

        <h3>Code Snippets</h3>
        <img alt="Image1 Illustrating Snippets" src="" class="image-1"/>
        <p class="description">To make rapid prototyping and final development as efficient as possible, I've created a library of code snippets for our developers. Most common application elements and some complete tasks are available as html/css/js snippets. This not only increases efficiencies, it also ensures more consistent front-end code.</p>

        <h3>User and usability testing</h3>
        <p class="description">For user testing and usability testing, I like to use tools like surveys and feedback forms, Peek, A/B testing, the occasional focus group, and semi-annual touchpoint meetings with the client.</p>
