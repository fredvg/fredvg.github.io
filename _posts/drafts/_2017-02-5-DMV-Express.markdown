feature2_description: "With a strong emphasis on user centric and task driven design, the new application is much easier to use and instills much greater trust. The visual design matches the official State of Vermont look and feel. Needles to say, this service is fully accessible and responsive."

<p>DMV Express is an online service that allows citizens to interact with the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles. Since the front-end hasn't been updated since its original launch in 2004, the application is badly outdated, not very intuitive to use and limited in functionality.</p>
<p>We opted for a phased approach, first we decoupled the front-end from the back-end (yes, a thirteen year old application means that this hadn't been done yet). Then we redesigned the front-end from the ground up. In a second phase we will add additional functionality (DMV services such as license renewals).</p>
