problem_title: "DMV Express redesign"
problem_description: "DMV Express is an online service that allows citizens to interact with the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles. Since the front-end hasn't been updated since its original launch in 2004, the application is badly outdated, not very intuitive to use, and limited in functionality. We opted for a phased approach, first we decoupled the front-end from the back-end (yes, a thirteen year old application means that this hadn't been done yet). Then we redesigned the front-end from the ground up. In a second phase we will add additional functionality (DMV services such as license renewals)."
challenges_title: "Challenges"
challenges_description: "<p>Even though the application has gone without significant changes in 13 years, DMV Express 1.0 was still a very popular and well-loved online service for State of Vermont</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Both citizens and DMV employees have become very familiar with the UX/UI over the years</li>
                            <li>Many, sometimes complex, business rules results in a large amount of edge cases</li>
                            <li>Jumping ahead by over a decade, without much iterative change in between, means we'll skip right over incremental improvements and new trends that have happened since 2004</li>
                          </ul>

phase1_title: "Research"
phase1_description: "After closely examining the — limited — Google Analytics that we have available, and reviewining hundreds of customer support emails, I did user interviews, went on field trips, and organized stakeholder workshops. I drew story boards and journey maps, created personas and broke the various functions of the application down into user stories."

phase3_title: "Goals"
phase3_description: "Since this project is very much a work in progress, it's too early to share results. We have set some aggressive goals though and are confident that we'll be able to achieve them. The biggest cost savings come from reducing in-person visits to the DMV offices. The user-centric and much improved UX, combined with the new, responsive, UI will go a long way in achieving this. For mobile traffic alone we are aiming for a 12% increase in transactions the first year. Once we start implementing additional functionality, the number of transactions will grow exponentially."
