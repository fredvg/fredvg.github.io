problem_title: "Branding, logos, and illustrations"
problem_description: "Over the years I've been lucky to work on branding projects for a variety products and companies. I've designed visual languages, logos, illustrations, and other assets. While this design work is very different from interaction design, I've found plenty of overlap in my processes and approach."
challenges_title: "Challenges"
challenges_description: "<p>Most of these projects were as part of my day job. Since that means I'm working with state government for a small state, there are some very specific challenges:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Limited resources</li>
                            <li>Lack of visual frameworks</li>
                            <li>No, or very few, graphic assets available</li>
                          </ul>

phase1_title: "Vermont Interactive Branding"
phase1_description: "As we plan to rename our company from the inaccurate and hard to pronounce Vermont Information Consortium to Vermont Interactive, we need a new brand. In order to determine our core message and voice, I conducted interviews, and organized workshops, with internal and external stakeholders. While the rebranding is a work in progress, the current version of the logo is very close to final. The new logo features the classic Vermont mountains silhouette. This graphic element is a subtle nod to the official State of Vermont&nbsp;logo."

phase3_title: "Illustrations"
phase3_description: "When we helped the Vermont DMV with their new website, it quickly became clear that they had very little graphic assets to pick from. I designed a visual language that appealed to their wide-ranging audience, is very friendly and inviting, and incorporates several classical Vermont motifs. I created a handful of graphics for the initial roll-out and the Chief Marketing Office for State of Vermont will use the system to create more matching illustrations for future use."
