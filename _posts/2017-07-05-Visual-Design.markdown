problem_title: "Branding, logos, and illustrations"
problem_description: "<p>Over the years I've been lucky enough to participate in branding for a variety of projects, products and companies. I've designed logos, illustrations, and visual assets. While this design work is obviously very different from interaction design, there are plenty of similarities in my process and approach."

phase1_title: "Vermont Interactive Branding"
phase1_description: "As we consider renaming our company from the inaccurate and hard to pronounce Vermont Information Consortium to Vermont Interactive, we need a new logo, color palette and style guide. While the new name is not yet in use and the rebranding is very much a work in progress, here’s an indication of where it’s headed. I conducted interviews with internal and external stakeholders to define our message and voice and then set out to create a brand to match those. The new logo incorporates the classic Vermont mountains silhouette. This graphic element is a subtle nod to the official State of Vermont&nbsp;logo."

phase3_title: "Illustrations"
phase3_description: "When we helped the Vermont DMV with their new website, it quickly became clear that they had very little graphic assets to pick from. I designed a visual language that appealed to their wide-ranging audience, is very friendly and inviting, and incorporates several classical Vermont motifs. I created several graphics for the initial roll-out and the Chief Marketing Office for State of Vermont will use the system to create more matching illustrations for future use."
