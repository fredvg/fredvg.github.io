problem_title: "Drupal 7 CMS"
problem_description: "The State of Vermont government had a disjointed web presence with about 50 websites in a variety of Drupal 6 and 7 CMS systems. In an effort to strengthen the Vermont state's brand, and consolidate the sites in one system powered by one theme, we undertook a big CMS migration project. I designed and developed a Drupal 7 CMS system in close collaboration with the state's Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)."

challenges_description: "<p>Since the CMS is a complimentary service, and there is no budget allocation for the state's web presence, keeping cost low was crucial.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Design a low maintenance, but very flexible, system without knowing actual content</li>
                            <li>Consolidate a variety of sites with separate feature sets and designs into one unified system</li>
                            <li>Vermont brand specific look and feel that works for a variety of audiences. Allow for individual branding and functional flexibility</li>
                          </ul>

                      <li>Design a flexible, responsive, layout that is extensively customizable through the use of Regions, Blocks, Views, and Widgets</li>
                      <li>Minimize the use of Contrib Modules in an effort to reduce maintenance and support. Maximize the built-in functionality of Drupal Core</li>
                      <li>Bi-weekly sprints that culminate in work sessions with CMO to allow for quick iteration</li>
                      </ul>"

phase3_title: "Outcome"
phase3_description: "We managed to achieve all of the above and —almost— kept project hours within the allocated budget. The new template was very well received and adoption rates for the CMS grew exponentially. Two years later, all Drupal 6 sites had been migrated and the total number of sites had grown to over 100. Today, the system serves tens of thousands of visitors monthly and saves the State of Vermont an estimated $1,000,000 annually."
