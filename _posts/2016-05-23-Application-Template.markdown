feature1_description: "<p>Instead of native applications we try to make our web services mobile-first browser based applications. Few government services are accessed regularly enough for people to justify installing native apps. It also leaves us with more control over the experience. No app store rules to worry about or delays when pushing out updates.</p>"

HTML, CSS and JS libraries combined with a style guide allow our developers to create online services that fit nicely with the State of Vermont web identity. This enhances trust, improves the User Experience and greatly increases code re-use.
